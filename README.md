# Beer Vault 

Beer Vault is a reference architecture for me to explore new technoliges and apply them to a common domain.  This repo is for the documentation that desribes the project and the overall architecture.  Over time it will evolve.

## Releases
Once I get to MVP for some functionality I will release it by way of tagging the repo and adding a description here.

| Release  | Tag  | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
|          |      |             |

### This still left to explore TODO
- Tag the first release in Github
- Do a subsritpion with a new beer created.  I will have to have two graphqls.
- Error handling with real messages and hiding stack traces and exceptions.
- Connect to a real database
- Seed database with Flyway
- Develop a React front-end to call call the API
